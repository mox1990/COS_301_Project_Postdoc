	\section{Introduction} %Carlo
	Post-Doctoral fellow a person who conducts research after they have completed their doctoral studies, with the aim of deepening their knowledge in a specific field. The University of Pretoria has a number of post doctoral fellows who conduct their research under the supervision of somebody in the University, and a large portion of this research is funded by the university.

	\section{Vision} %Carlo	
	\vspace{0.2in}
	The client simply needs a system which can make the application process of Post Doctoral fellows run smoother. The system will include an easy to use web interface for the applicants and an application for all the stakeholders involved in the rest of the application process. As soon as a step is concluded the system will forward the documentation to the next stakeholder in the process. By introducing a system that is not paper based, the client hopes that the application process will be easier to track on the side of the applicant. The system will also provide better reporting, tracking, audit-ability and accountability with regards to all the other stakeholders involved in the application process. The system needs to be centralised to ensure access to documents and/or information for the different stakeholders
	\vspace{0.5in}
	
	\newpage
	\section{Background} %Carlo
	\vspace{0.2in}
	The current Post-Doctoral application process is paper based and with this a number of problems have been experienced. There is no audit trail when it comes to the different departments involved in approving or declining the applications, minutes of meetings are often misplaced or typed in an inconsistent manner making it hard to recall what has been discussed in the meetings that take place during the application process. Access to documents is a problem since their are a number of different stakeholders, the process of getting hold of the documents is long and often tedious.The reporting of the number of fellows, renewals, communication with fellows and the number of fellows in each department is also a problem, because the current process is not centralised and gathering all the information required to generate reports is a problem.

		\subsection{Access channel requirements} %Carlo
		\vspace{0.2in}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Post-Doctoral Applicants: Will access the system through a web browser client which will be compatible with the web browsers found in modern phones. 
		\end{itemize}
		\item Other Stakeholders: Will access the system through a Java application found on the computers used by them in their offices.
		\item % Will the UP system interact/access our system?

		\subsection{Quality requirements} %Mathys
		\vspace{0.2in}
		
		\vspace{0.2in}
		
		\subsection{Integration requirements} %Alfred
		\vspace{0.2in}
		The system has to integrate with the following systems:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A MySQL database.
			\item A mobile (android) application used to record minutes of the meetings by the stakeholders. 
			\item An emailing service? %I need to recitfy this a bit.
			\item Adobe API used when generating reports.
			\item We should define a protocol which will be used to handle communication within the network!!!
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{0.2in}
		
		\subsection{Architecture constraints} %Alfred
		\vspace{0.2in}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Architecture: Agile approach
			\item Database technology: MySQL
			\item Platform: Java EE
			\item Web server: Apache Tomcat and GlassFish 
			\item It must run using HTTP requests and response events to connect to the
database.
			\item Client interface platforms 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Web browser
					\item Android
					\item Mobile web browser
				\end{itemize}
			\item Text encoding: UTF-8

	\section{Functional requirements}
		\subsection{Introduction} %Alfred
		\vspace{0.2in}
		This project aims to digitize the completely paper based application process which is currently being used to solicite post gradutate fellows and researchers to the University of Pretoria. Such transformation will allow for the centralization of all the required documents in a logically one point. Avoiding the cases where documents were lost while being transferred from stake holder to stake holder.
