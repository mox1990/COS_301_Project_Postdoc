\section{Document description:}
This document provides the documenting for the software architecture requirements which the application functionality is deployed and executed.


\subsection{Document purpose:}
\vspace{0.2in}
The Architecture Requirements Specification provides a set of quantitative statements that outline what the Post-Doctoral Application must do in order to comply with the architecture required by the client. Thus this document serves as a contract between SoftServe and the client, Mrs Cathy Sandis of the DRIS of the University of Pretoria in terms of project functional requirements.

\vspace{0.2in}

\subsection{Documentation methodology}
\vspace{0.2in}
\begin{flushleft}
The documentation and software development methodology used by the project adhere to the guidelines set out by the agile method. Thus this document has undergone and will undergo various iterations that may extend or reduce the contents of the document.\\

This document was created using the requirement elicitation techniques and requirement definitions as specified by Klaus Pohl’s book Requirements Engineering: Fundamentals, Principles, and Techniques [Dr.Phol, K., 2010].
The requirements, vision and scope were elicited from the following sources:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Numerous interviews with the client.
	\item On-line research into UP Post doctoral applications.
	\item Correspondence with the UP IT department.
	\item Collecting and analysing various documents such as:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The initial project request document
			\item Application forms
			\item Renewal forms
			\item CV templates
			\item Approval and recommendation forms
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

\section{Architecture requirements}
\subsection{Access channel requirements} %Carlo
\vspace{0.2in}
\begin{itemize}

\item\textbf{All stakeholders:}
Will access the system through a HTML 5 web browser client that is locally installed on a user's computer system or mobile platform. Support for HTML 4.0.1 will also be implemented. The web interface will allow different stakeholders access to different sections of the system based on the roles assigned to their accounts.

\item\textbf{System Administrator:}

Will access have access to the MySQL database.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integration requirements} %Alfred
\vspace{0.2in}
The system has to integrate with the following systems:
\begin{itemize}
\item Must be able to create exportable data packages containing the information of approved fellowships that can easily be loaded into the CSC PeopleSoft system.
\item Must be able to query CSC PeopleSoft system to retrieve the account information of internal individuals/group Stakeholders to create a uniform login experience.
\item Must assign Prospective fellows with a id number in such a way that is integrable with UP Emplid. SoftServe suggests: "f" + 8 digit code.
\item Must be able to access and utilize the NRF researcher ratings.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.2in}

\subsection{Architecture constraints} %Alfred
\vspace{0.2in}
The following architecture constraints have been selected as being suitable for the system.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Database technology: MySQL
\item Development technology: Java EE
\item Application server: GlassFish
\item Web interface protocol: HTTPS
\end{enumerate}
