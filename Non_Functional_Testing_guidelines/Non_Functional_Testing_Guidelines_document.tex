\section{Document description:}

\subsection{Document purpose:}
\vspace{0.2in}
This vision and scope document serves the purpose of providing a detailed overview of the project's scope and its vision as well the goals that SoftServe's Post-Doctoral application management system wishes to satisfy. Further it defines the abstract interaction of stakeholders with the proposed software system. Thus this document serves as a contract between SoftServe and the client, Mrs Cathy Sandis of the DRIS of the University of Pretoria in terms of project scope.

\vspace{0.2in}

\subsection{Documentation methodology}
\vspace{0.2in}
\begin{flushleft}
The documentation and software development methodology used by the project adhere to the guidelines set out by the agile method. Thus this document has undergone and will undergo various iterations that may extend or reduce the contents of the document.\\

This document was created using the requirement elicitation techniques and requirement definitions as specified by Klaus Pohl’s book Requirements Engineering: Fundamentals, Principles, and Techniques [Dr.Phol, K., 2010].
The requirements, vision and scope were elicited from the following sources:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Numerous interviews with the client.
	\item On-line research into UP Post doctoral applications.
	\item Correspondence with the UP IT department.
	\item Collecting and analysing various documents such as:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The initial project request document
			\item Application forms
			\item Renewal forms
			\item CV templates
			\item Approval and recommendation forms
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

\item ERD Crow-Foot notation
\item UML 2.0

\section{User acceptance tests}
This user acceptance document, as specified in the "V" model for testing, is a quality assurance activity through by which we will be enabled to ensure that the new system does actually meet the essential user requirements. It acts as a means to gain quality assurance as it allows to detect deviations between the implementation of the system and the specified requirements. Since test cases are essentially derived from the quality and functional requirements provided by the requirement engineering process. Quality assurance, in turn, requests requirements engineering to resolve  requirements defects detected during quality assurance activities and if necessary, to clarify requirements to enable the specification of adequate test artefacts (Pohl 2010).

This section test items and identifiers with regards to the systems behaviour. All the steps entailed below are added to the audit log.
