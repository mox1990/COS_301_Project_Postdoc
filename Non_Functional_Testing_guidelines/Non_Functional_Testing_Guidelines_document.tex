\section{Document description:}

\subsection{Document purpose:}
\vspace{0.2in}
This non-functional testing document serves the purpose of providing a detailed testing plan and test cases for non-functional testing of the system. Therefore the user acceptance testing of the system is covered by this document. Thus this document serves as a contract between SoftServe and the client, Mrs Cathy Sandis of the DRIS of the University of Pretoria in terms of non-functional quality assurance.

\vspace{0.2in}

\subsection{Documentation methodology}
\vspace{0.2in}
\begin{flushleft}
The documentation and software development methodology used by the project adhere to the guidelines set out by the agile method. Thus this document has undergone and will undergo various iterations that may extend or reduce the contents of the document.\\

The document was formualated using techniques described by Ammann P. and Offutt J.. Also used were techniques and skills obtained from the COS 301 course.

\section{User acceptance tests}
As specified in the V-model for testing user acceptance tests are developed alongside the requirement engineering ans is a quality assurance activity by which the new system is tested for compliance with the actually requirements in terms of quality and functional. It allows the SoftServe group to detect deviations between the implementation of the system and the specified requirements. The test cases are essentially derived from the quality and functional requirements provided by the requirement engineering process. Thus to resolve it the system or requirements need to be changed (Pohl 2010).

This section tests items and identifiers with regards to the systems behaviour. All the steps entailed below are added to the audit log.

\subsection{Notifications}
The system will need to generate automated notifications that are sent internally and to
the corresponding email of the recipient. To prevent spamming the system will only allow
users with the correct security roles to make use of the service. It is important that this
service runs asynchronously after it has been engaged since the service makes use of external
systems that may be un-responsive. In case where the external systems fail this services
needs to handle it.
\begin{itemize}
\item
The system must be able to create a new notification.
\item
The system must be able to send notifications.
\item
The system must be able to allow the user to specify the recipients and senders.
\item
