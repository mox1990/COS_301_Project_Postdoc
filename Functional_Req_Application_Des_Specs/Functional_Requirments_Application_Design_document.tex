\section{Functional requirements}
\subsection{Introduction} %Alfred
\vspace{0.2in}
This section outlines the functional requirements for SoftServe's Post-Doctoral management system.
The required functionality, domain objects, process specification and use cases related to the functional requirements of the project will be discussed in this sections.
\vspace{0.2in}

\subsection{Required functionality} %Alfred
\vspace{0.2in}
The following sections will discuss the required functionality of all the major services handled by the system. Namely:
\begin{itemize}
	\item User gateway
	\item Application services
	\item Non-Application services
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{User gateway}
	The user gateway provides the access control services of the system and acts as a centralised gateway through which all users have to go in order to gain access to the system and its services. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The gateway must provide a user login facility which allows the users to authenticate themselves using their account user name or email address and their account password.
		\item The gateway must insure that the correct user privileges are loaded before allowing the system to proceed.
		\item The gateway must insure that the user is allocated a session so that the system can identify the user.
		\item All internal stakeholders should be able to log in with their PeopleSoft account details once the system is integrated but until such time they should login with the credentials specified at the time of account creation. 
		\item The gateway needs to facilitate user account recovery.
		 
	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Application services}
	The application services encompasses the entirety of the of the Post-Doctoral application processes undergone by prospective and research fellows namely new and renewal applications.\\\\
	The main users of these services will be the prospective and research fellows who wishes to apply for a new Post-Doctoral fellowship or renew their current fellowship or track the progress of any of their applications within the application work-flow. The majority of stakeholders will only make use of particular set of services which are provided under the Application services. Therefore most of the different stakeholders' usage of the system will be focused in this set of services only as these services capture the work-flow of the application processes. \\\\As specified in the vision and scope document under section 7.2 the application process of each application is broken up into stages. These stages run concurrently until they reach the stage where the post-doctoral committee meeting is to take place. In this particular stage the applications are batch reviewed. After which all reviewed eligible applications are once again processed individually. In order to manage the work flow of applications a notification event will trigger after each stage is complete and the applications will be automatically forwarded to the next by means of changing the application status. Only the DRIS will have the power to forward or rewind any application through the stages. It should be noted that if the DRIS moves an application back then all the data of the stages that have been complete will be removed.\\\\These services will capture the work-flow diagram in the Vision and Scope document, section 7.2 - Figure 2 as follows:
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item\textbf{Application status levels:} Each stage the application goes through requires a different type of task to be preformed or group of tasks to be preformed by the appropriate user.

Note * indicates that the stage is different for new and renewal applications: 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{*Open application} - This application is a newly created prospective or renewal application.
			\item \textbf{*Submitted application} - This application is submitted by the fellow and awaits referral if referral is required else it is automatically moved to Referred status.
			\item \textbf{*Referred application} - This application has a completed list of referral reports from the specified referees or if the application is a renewal that that has been submitted. Note no referees are required for UP PhD Postdoc or Externally funded applications.

			\item Allow the creation and activation of On-demand users which are users which don't have an account but need an account with other privileges than a prospective fellow account.
		\end{enumerate}
	
		\item\textbf{Notification services:}
		The system will need to generate automated notifications that are sent internally and to the corresponding email of the recipient. To prevent spamming the system will only allow users with the correct security roles to make use of the service. It is important that this service runs asynchronously after it has been engaged since the service makes use of external systems that may be un-responsive. In case where the external systems fail this services needs to handle it.

Further it should be able to remove old records from the working database that are no longer in use and store then in a location so that they can be retrieved on a on-demand basis.
		\begin{enumerate}		
			\item The system administrator needs to be able to perform a automatic archival of old data.
			\item The system administrator needs to be able to perform a backup of the current database.
			\item The system should be able to notify the system administrator of any possible archival data.
			\item The system administrator needs to be able to restore any backed up or archived data.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item\textbf{Application import services}
		The application import services will be used to import existing applications into the system via a GUI wizard. It will not make use of batch import, nor will it import from files.
		\begin{enumerate}		
			\item The DRIS member will be able to import applications: to the extend where they include their core application information, fellow, grant holder and funding report as the other information is not required to manage a already approved application.
			\item Once the data is finalised it cannot be changed by this service.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item\textbf{Location management services:}
		The system will need to manage the current locations that exist with in the institutions that are registered with the system. A location is the a department, faculty or institution. Departments may be fictional and used as a simple place holder for cross departmental applications. Also if integration with peoplesoft or another system is to occur it will allow this service to synchronise with it. This will be a system service and not be exposed directly to users except in the case of the system administrator wishing to edit or create new locations. Though in order to preserve data integrity locations cannot be removed.
		\begin{enumerate}		
			\item The service must allow the creation and update of locations.
			\item The service needs to be able to retrieve all institutions.
			\item The service needs to be able to retrieve all faculties in the institution.
			\item The service needs to be able to retrieve all departments under a faculty of a particular institution.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item\textbf{CV management services:}
		Each grant holder, prospective fellow and research fellow will have a CV. Thus this service will provide the management there of. This will be a system service which will be used indirectly the users of the system. 
		\begin{enumerate}		
			\item The service must be able to create and update a CV for a particular user.
			\item Prospective fellows can only update/create their CVs at the start of a new application.

\subsubsection{Request and result data structures}
The system will be following a object oriented approach due it being the paradigm of the Java programming language. Therefore the input and output structure will mainly be in the form of objects. Also the objects that will be produced and used inside the system will adhere to the domain objects specification found the following section. The flow of these structures are also provided below in form of data flow diagrams in the following sections


\newpage
\subsection{Domain Objects}

\section{Application Design}
This section deals with actual design of the application itself and how the requirement will be implemented.
\subsection{Overview}
As seen from the various functional requirements above the application covers vast number of services and domain objects. Thus in order to break down and structure the application so that it doesn't become an complicate and unmaintainable system the application will make use of the Java EE reference framework which automatically implies a layered architectural pattern and provides many out of the box services. This is as discussed in the Software architectural document.

\begin{figure}[H]

\framebox{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../Images_Docs/Diagrams/System/overview1.png}}

\newpage
\subsection{Client layer}
\subsubsection{Summary}
The client layer provides a single web interface that makes use of the JSF facelet technology and Primefaces component kit in order to provide the a interactive, attractive and cohesive user interface. This web interface communicates with the JSF backing beans in the client layer through means of Java Expression language and Servelet technology as document in the Software Architecture document. Additionally this layer can be populated by other systems that can communicate other the internet using HTTPS by utilising the RESTful web services in the web layer. Some concept and template samples for the website design has been provided below:

\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{Client layer}
\subsubsection{Summary}
The Client layer will provide JSF backing beans in order to process, validate and structure the input from the front-end web interface to the EJB layer and vice versa. The managed beans will also be used to provide the support for the front-end by using a variety of CDI scopes in order to retain important information and discard once off information:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Application scope
	\item Session scope
	\item Conversation scope
	\item Request scope
	\item Dependent scope
\end{itemize}
Also provided by this layer are the RESTful web-services which in essence provide the same functionality as the JSF backing beans but for other systems or UIs. 
Further the Context and Dependency Injection (CDI) Technology will be used provide communication between managed beans and web services themselves and the EJBs.


\newpage
\subsection{EJB Layer}
\subsubsection{Summary}
The EJB layer will provide the back bone for the business logic and capture all the core non UI-related logic as seen by the class diagrams of the various interfaces below. Majority of the functions provided by the EJB layer will be expecting domain objects as stipulated above and only in some rare instances will expect primitives or non-domain objects. All the EJBs are stateless and all provide a local interface. Also in order to preform user authentication and auditing custom interceptors designed for these purposes where designed as well as accompanying custom method annotations to specify parameters for audit able and secured methods by the EJBs. Also in order to conform to the layered architecture no communication with Persistence layer is allowed with out using the EJB layer. Also since the system will make use of RestFul API inorder to integrate with other software this Layer needs to be completely secure. 

\subsubsection{Annotations}
This sections provides a overview of all the custom annotations used by the system.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{AuditableMethod} - Used to indicate the method needs to be audited and what audit message should be used.
	\item \textbf{SecuredMethod} - Used to indicate the method needs authentication, the allowed security roles, if to test for ownership and what is the object to test ownership of.
	\item \textbf{PrePostConditionalMethod} - Used to indicate the method needs to be evaluated by the script in the database to see if it can proceed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Persistence Layer}
\subsubsection{Summary}
The persistence layer is made up of three Relation MySQL databases each of which has precisely the same entity structure, as specified in the ERD diagram. These entities are the technological specific mapping of the persistence domain objects found above. The databases are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Working database - Used to store all the current data used by the application.
	\item Backup database - Used to store the latest full backup of the working database.
	\item Archive database - Used to store the any archived data that the application identified and moved from the working database. 
\end{itemize}

Ideally these databases should be store on separate database services to improve redundancy and fault tolerance. Though in the current situation this is not possible due to financial constraints.\\
In order to convert the relation entities to object representation for the EJB layer, the Eclipse Top-link JPA object relational mapper is used. Further to efficiently use storage space and increase maintainability of the large text data in the database certain text sections are in XML format. This string of text is converted to and from Objects using JAXB technology.  
As stipulated in the Software architecture document this the RDBMS can be replaced with ObjectDB if financial support is provided this would increase the performance, maintainability and cohesiveness of the data structures in the persistence layer.
