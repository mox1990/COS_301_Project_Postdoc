\section{July recess work plan}
This section describes the SoftServe's group work plan for the July recess.

\subsection{Expected work hours}
This section documents the expected work hours each member of the SoftServe's group specified they will contribute to the project. There are a total of 5 weeks in the period of 20/06/2014 to 22/07/2014. It should be noted that weekend days are not considered as work days by this plan.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mathys Ellis
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 4 hours per weekday
		\item 4 x 5 = 20 hours per week
		\item 20 x 5 = 100 hours over period
	\end{itemize}
	\item Tokologo “Carlo” Machaba
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 4 hours per weekday
		\item 4 x 5 = 20 hours per week
		\item 20 x 5 = 100 hours over period
	\end{itemize}
	\item Kgothatso Phatedi Alfred Ngako
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 6 hours per weekday
		\item 6 x 5 = 30 hours per week
		\item 30 x 5 = 150 hours over period
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Division of use cases}
This section provides the use cases each of the team members selected to do for the recess work plan. The selection process was as follows Kgothatso Phatedi Alfred Ngako and Tokologo “Carlo” Machaba selected which use cases they wished to do. Lastly Mathys Ellis selected the remaining use cases. It should be noted that the division of the use cases also relate with the expected work hours of each member.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mathys Ellis
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Post-doctoral fellow-ship management system use cases
		\item Application services use cases
		\item User account management services use cases
		\item Grant holder application finalisation service use cases
		\item HOD Approval service use cases
		\item Dean endorsement service use cases
		\item DRIS approval service use cases
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Tokologo “Carlo” Machaba
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item User gateway use cases
		\item Application progress viewer service use cases
		\item New fellowship application service use cases
		\item Application renewal service use cases
		\item Referees' report service use cases
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Kgothatso Phatedi Alfred Ngako
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Report services use cases
		\item Notification services use cases
		\item Audit-Trail services use cases
		\item Archival services use cases
		\item Imports and exports services use cases
		\item Meeting management service use cases
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tasks to be completed for each use case}
This section lists and describes the tasks that should be completed for each of the use cases specified above.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create interface diagram within the Model.eap file. In order to provide the expected APIs for other members, Document this in the Functional requirements document. This must be complete before the 12/06/2014.
	\item Document initial unit and integration tests in the functional testing document. This must be complete before the 30/06/2014.
	\item Complete the implementation of the back-end
	\item If the use case provides a front-end it must be implemented. Document the user work flow and UI design also.
	\item Develop JUnit tests alongside actual implementations 
	\item Document any extra use case diagrams if new sub services are developed.
	\item Document any process specification of an implemented functionality. 
	\item Document any additional unit and integration tests while implementing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional tasks}
This section lists and describes the additional tasks that should be completed by each member. These revolve around the awe factors that the SoftServe group wishes to implement. The tasks were divided according to the background and skill level of each member in terms of AI and 3D graphics. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mathys Ellis
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Research webGL and 3D user interfaces
		\item Help with design of interactive UI
		\item Research data mining and neural network techniques
		\item Identify data sources that can be used to gather data.
		\item Provide support in both the AI and 3D related topics.
		\item Editing of documentation
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Tokologo “Carlo” Machaba
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Research webGL and 3D user interfaces
		\item Design UI, standard and interactive
		\item Research and develop innovative user interaction mechanisms
		\item Initial documentation of 3D UI awe factor
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Kgothatso Phatedi Alfred Ngako
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Research data mining and neural network techniques with regards to evaluation, prediction, background check.
		\item Design viable data mining techniques.
		\item Identify valuable indicators in data.
		\item Identify data sources that can be used to gather data.
		\item Initial documentation of AI awe factor
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation}
In order to control the work flow and monitor each group members performance over the July Recess 2 evaluation reports will created. These reports will document the tasks completed by each member and those not completed yet. As well as any issues with regards to technical or implementation. The first report will occur at the end of week 2 and the second at the end of week 5.
