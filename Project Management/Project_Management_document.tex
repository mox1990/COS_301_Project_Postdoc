\subsection{Expected work hours}
This section documents the expected work hours each member of the SoftServe's group specified they will contribute to the project. There are a total of 5 weeks in the period of 20/06/2014 to 22/07/2014. It should be noted that weekend days are not considered as work days by this plan.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mathys Ellis

\subsection{Evaluation}
In order to control the work flow and monitor each group members performance over the July Recess 2 evaluation reports will created. These reports will document the tasks completed by each member and those not completed yet. As well as any issues with regards to technical or implementation. The first report will occur at the end of week 2 and the second at the end of week 5.

\subsubsection{Kgothatso Phatedi Alfred Ngako}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 23 June - 27 June: Worked on Notification services, Audit Trail services as they were highly prioritized. Started work on the meeting management services.
	\item 30 June - 3 July: Researched about PDF and Excel api for Java. Choose to work with iText and Apache POI respectively. Added API to dependencies. Added more business logic to Meeting Management services. Started on Report (mainly PDF and Excel. Reports) services and Import services.Created a more generic method to handle the many entities that require being exported.	
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Tokologo “Carlo” Machaba}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 20 - 29 June
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Tasks set out to do:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Completed backend and tests for Application Renwals, Referees Report.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Tasks completed:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Unit Tests
		\item Backend for use cases
	\end{itemize}
	\item Tasks not completed:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Backend for the rest of the use cases
	\end{itemize}	
	\item Challenges / obstacles faced:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Github faults and pulling issues.
		\item Learning JUnit 
		\item Using XML schema
		\item Access to Internet
	\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item 30 June - 6 July On holiday in Drakensburg.	 
\end{itemize}

It should be noted from the above and code commits that the back end is not near the expected level of completion and therefore it would be recommend that the whole group needs to focus the on the sections not completed nor integrated so that it can get done before the end of the weekend so that the project deadlines can be met.
